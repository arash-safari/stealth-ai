# BOOK planner (one-step ReAct)
BOOK_PLANNER = {"flow_name": "BOOK",
"description": "Customer wants to book a visit to repair a service.",
"required_slots" : ["address", "description", "time_window"],
"prompt":"""
Goal: create a booking after a clear confirmation.

Required slots: address, description, time_window.

You see: {history}, {state.slots+confidence}, {tools}

Output EXACTLY ONE tool call:
  next_action(name, args_json, rationale)

Policy:
1) If a required slot is missing → ASK_* for that slot (one ask per turn).
2) If a question needs options/data → run the TOOL first (e.g., find_available_window before asking time).
3) After address captured → check_if_support_address. If unsupported → say short apology then finish.
4) When all slots confident → confirm once, then create_booking. If nothing left → finish.

Actions you may choose:
- ASK_ADDRESS(question="What's the service address?", expected="Street + ZIP")
- ASK_ISSUE(question="What seems to be the problem?", expected="Short description")
- SUGGEST_WINDOWS(tool=find_available_window)
- ASK_TIME_WINDOW(question="What time works for you? {time_1} or {time_2}", expected="4-hour window", question_vars from tools.suggested_windows)
- VALIDATE_ADDRESS_ZONE(tool=check_if_support_address)
- CONFIRM_BOOKING(text="Confirm this appointment at {address} to fix '{description}' within {time_window}?")
- CREATE_BOOKING(tool=create_booking)
- DONE_WRAP()
